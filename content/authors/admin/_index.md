I am a junior majoring in **Automation** at Fuzhou University (China) and **Robotics & Intelligent Devices** at Maynooth University (Ireland, Combined Degrees). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://dqxy.fzu.edu.cn/info/1102/3547.htm) and [Dr. Chin Hong Wong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chin-Hong-Wong). My current research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Industrial IoT**.
